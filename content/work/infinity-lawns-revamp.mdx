## Problem
Leads were inconsistent. IA buried key services, and mobile speed was poor.

## Constraints
Small local business, minimal budget. Needed measurable lift quickly.

## Approach
- Rebuilt IA: Services → Packages → Book
- Improved image strategy with `next/image` + AVIF and responsive sizes
- Clear CTAs, sticky mobile call bar, better trust cues
- GA4 events for CTA clicks & form starts; Lighthouse budgets
- A11y pass (focus, color contrast, keyboard nav)

## Solution
A cleaner services flow, lightweight components, and clearer CTAs.

## Impact
- +52% quote requests in first 30 days
- LCP to ~2.1s on 4G
- Bounce rate -18% on service landers
- Client reported easier bookings via mobile
