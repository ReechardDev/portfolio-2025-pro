## Problem
Old flow felt generic and confusing. Families needed reassurance + clarity.

## Constraints
Brand refresh needed to stay calm/approachable; avoid heavy scripts.

## Approach
- Re-wrote care plan copy with plain language & pricing clarity
- “Most Popular” plan tag + FAQs; sticky CTA on mobile
- Performance budget (no heavy libs), image compression, route prefetch
- GA4 events for CTA positions; light A/B on button copy

## Solution
A trustworthy, accessible website with clearer plans and smoother contact.

## Impact
- Longer engagement on Care Plans (+31%)
- More form starts (+24%)
- Very low CLS (0.02) for calmer experience
