## Problem
The product pages were slow and cluttered. Trust signals were buried, and checkout friction was high on mobile.

## Constraints
Small team, existing design tokens, tight deadline. Needed measurable results within a month.

## Approach
- Audited funnel, defined GA4 events & key user journeys
- Simplified PDP hierarchy, improved image loading with `next/image` and AVIF
- Added trust badges, shipping/returns clarity near the Add-to-Cart
- Reduced checkout steps, improved field labels & error states
- Lighthouse + Web Vitals budgets, a11y pass (contrast & focus)

## Solution
A clean, fast PDP and a predictable checkout—especially on mobile. Subtle motion on interactions to reinforce affordances.

## Impact
- +38% conversion over 30 days (stat-sig)
- LCP down to 1.8s on 4G
- Bounce rate -22% on landing pages
- Positive user feedback about clarity and speed
